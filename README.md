# A-Deep-Learning-Based-Forest-Wild-Fire-Detection
This project implements an intelligent forest wildfire detection system using deep learning to identify fire and smoke from images or video streams with high accuracy. The goal is to provide an early-warning mechanism that helps prevent large-scale forest damage by detecting wildfire signs in real time.
